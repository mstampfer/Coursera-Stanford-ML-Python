# ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
# Instructions: You should complete the following code to train num_labels
#               logistic regression classifiers with regularization
#               parameter lambda. 
#
# Hint: theta(:) will return a column vector.
#
# Hint: You can use y == c to obtain a vector of 1's and 0's that tell use 
#       whether the ground truth is true/false for this class.
#
# Note: For this assignment, we recommend using fmincg to optimize the cost
#       function. It is okay to use a for-loop (for c = 1:num_labels) to
#       loop over the different classes.

    # Set Initial theta
    initial_theta = np.zeros((n + 1, 1))

    # This function will return theta and the cost
