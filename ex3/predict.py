# ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
# Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
#               your learned neural network. You should set p to a 
#               vector containing labels between 1 to num_labels.
#
# Hint: The max function might come in useful. In particular, the max
#       function can also return the index of the max element, for more
#       information see 'help max'. If your examples are in rows, then, you
#       can use max(A, [], 2) to obtain the max for each row.
#

# =========================================================================

    return p + 1        # add 1 to offset index of maximum in A row
